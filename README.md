## Challenge Instructions
This project utilizes Python and SQLAlchemy to achieve basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database in Hawaii. Based on the initial analysis, a Flask API was designed by using these queries.

## Climate Analysis and Exploration
The basic climate analysis was completed by using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Precipitation Analysis
A query was designed to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data
The date and prcp values of the query results were selected and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame
The results were sorted by date and plotted using plot method
A summary statistics for the precipitation data was displayed using Pandas


## Station Analysis
A query was designed to calculate the total number of stations in Hawaii
The query finds the most active stations using functions as func.min, func.max, func.avg, and func.count
Another query was designed to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS), which were later filtered by the station with the highest number of observations and plotted as a histogram with bins=12


## Climate App
A Flask API was designed based on the queries from above and Flask jsonify was used to convert API data into a valid JSON response object. Routes were created as follows:

/
Home page
List all routes that are available
/api/v1.0/precipitation
Convert the query results to a dictionary using date as the key and prcp as the value
Return the JSON representation of your dictionary
/api/v1.0/stations
Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset
/api/v1.0/tobs
Query the dates and temperature observations of the most active station for the last year of data
Return a JSON list of temperature observations (TOBS) for the previous year
/api/v1.0/<start> and /api/v1.0/<start>/<end>
Return a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start or start-end range
When given the start only, calculate TMIN, TAVG, and TMAX for all dates greater than and equal to the start date
When given the start and the end date, calculate the TMIN, TAVG, and TMAX for dates between the start and end date inclusive
BONUS: Other Analyses
Temperature Analysis I
Hawaii is reputed to enjoy mild weather all year. Is there a meaningful difference between the temperature in, for example, June and December? Here the SQLAlchemy was used to identify the average temperature in June at all stations across all available years in the dataset. Same method was applied to December temperature.

The unpaired t-test was used because it's comparing the means of two independent samples (Jun vs. Dec). Based on the t-test result, the difference in the means of Jun vs Dec was statistically significant.

Temperature Analysis II
The function calc_temps was used to calculate the min, avg, and max temperature for my trip (2017-03-01 to 2017-03-10) from the previous year (2016-03-01 to 2016-03-10). A bar chart was created using the average temperature as the height and the peak-to-peak (TMAX-TMIN) value as the y error bar (YERR).



## Daily Rainfall Average
The rainfall per weather station was calculated using the previous year's matching dates. The daily normals of my trip (2017-03-01 to 2017-03-10), including the average of the min, avg, and max temperatures, were also calculated by the daily_normals function. In the end, an area plot (stacked=False) was created for the daily normal during my trip.
